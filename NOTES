CHANGE1 - API response caching
Test plan
    Ideally, mock the API to simulate endpoint success and failure responses.
    http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/testing.html

    As the API throws GuzzleException often enough, it was quicker to mock scenarios manually.
    So to start a test repeat: delete local cache, then refresh page until required response received.

    Scenario 1 :
    Given an empty cache,
    When I refresh page and API returns a GuzzleException
    Then I expect to see an error message, and no page in /cache directory
    (note: the handler does cache something for 301 which I'll ignore for now)

    Scenario 2 : (not tested manually)
    Given Scenario 1
    When a second refresh also returns a GuzzleException
    Then I expect to see an error message, and no page in /cache directory

    Scenario 3 :
    Given Scenario 1
    When a second refresh returns a valid response
    Then I expect to see the episodes, and the page in /cache directory

    Scenario 4 :
    Given Scenario 3
    When a further refresh is requested
    Then check page is returned from /cache
    To save time, I placed a breakpoint at line 138 in
        vendor/kevinrob/guzzle-cache-middleware/src/CacheMiddleware.php
        verified using Xdebug that request fetched from cacheStorage
