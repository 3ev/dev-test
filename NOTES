Issue 2 - show user-friendly messages on Guzzle exceptions
Release notes : there are unhandled Twig exceptions, raise a separate issue

Test Plan
Ideally Mock the API to simulate error and success responses.
Replicate issue without the patch.
Apply patch.
Verify view contains desired error message on Guzzle Exception
Verify view behaviour unchanged on successful API response
